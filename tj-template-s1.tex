\IEEEPARstart{U}{ser}-item recommendation systems are crucial in modern digital platforms, driving personalized experiences in domains such as e-commerce, streaming services, and social media. These systems leverage machine learning to predict user preferences based on historical interactions, ensuring that users receive relevant content, products, or services. However, optimizing recommendation systems remains a significant challenge due to the need for high accuracy, computational efficiency, and adaptability to evolving user behavior.

In this project, we aim to study different optimization techniques for user-item recommendation systems, focusing on methods that enhance recommendation accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, we investigate the effectiveness of Collaborative Filtering, Content-enriched recommendation, temporal models, and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in improving recommendation performance. Mathematically, all these methods are trying to optimize the following problem:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:opt}
\begin{aligned}
	\hat{R}_{ui} = f(u, i \mid \Theta)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $\hat{R}_{ui}$ is the predicted rating for user $u$ on item $i$, $f$ is the optimization function, and $\Theta$ represents the model parameters. The goal is to minimize the prediction error between the predicted ratings and the actual ratings, typically using a loss function such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE).


TODO: fix the explaining sentences by reflecting the new section separations more
Different learning-based optimization techniques approach this problem in distinct ways. Autoencoders treat recommendation as a latent representation learning problem, compressing user-item interactions into a lower-dimensional space to extract meaningful embeddings that reveal hidden relationships. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) take a spatial feature extraction approach, applying convolutional filters to structured representations of user-item interactions to capture local patterns and shared item attributes. Neural Attention Mechanisms cast recommendation as a context-aware learning problem, dynamically weighting past interactions to focus on the most relevant items and personalize recommendations. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) frame recommendation as a sequential prediction problem, leveraging temporal dependencies in user behavior to anticipate future preferences. Meanwhile, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) treats recommendation as a decision-making problem under uncertainty, optimizing long-term user engagement by learning policies that maximize cumulative satisfaction.

By systematically comparing these approaches, we aim to provide insights into their respective strengths, weaknesses, and practical trade-offs.

\section{Related Works}

\subsection{Collaborative Filtering}
Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a widely used technique for building recommendation systems, leveraging past user-item interactions (such as ratings) to generate personalized recommendations. Traditional CF models like matrix factorization and neighborhood-based methods both have limitations in capturing complex patterns in user preferences \cite{sedhain2015autorec}.

The limitation lies in high computational cost and parameter inefficiency. Biased Matrix Factorization Collaborative Filtering (RBM-CF) requires contrastive divergence for training, which can be slow and it models discrete rating levels separately, leading to increased memory requirements. Furthermore, generalization is limited because matrix factorization techniques assume a linear latent representation, which may not effectively capture nonlinear user-item interactions. Therefore one of the gaps lies in developing a more efficient and expressive CF model using deep learning, one that maintains computational efficiency while improving predictive performance \cite{sedhain2015autorec}.

The authors of \cite{sedhain2015autorec} introduced AutoRec, an autoencoder-based framework for collaborative filtering. The core idea is to treat user-item interactions as input to an autoencoder, which learns latent representations and reconstructs the missing ratings. The paper proposes two variants of AutoRec: Item-based AutoRec (I-AutoRec), which models item embeddings and reconstructs user ratings, and User-based AutoRec (U-AutoRec), which models user embeddings and reconstructs item ratings. Compared to previous models, AutoRec introduces several key improvements. First, it offers more efficient training by using gradient-based backpropagation instead of the computationally expensive contrastive divergence required by RBM-CF. Second, it reduces parameter count as it does not require separate parameter estimation for different rating levels, unlike RBM-CF. Finally, AutoRec enables nonlinear representation learning through activation functions such as sigmoid, allowing it to capture more complex user-item interactions compared to traditional matrix factorization, which assumes a linear latent representation \cite{sedhain2015autorec}.

AutoRec has several limitations. It is a relatively simple model, and while a deeper version has been tested, the performance improvements are minimal, suggesting that deeper models may require further adjustments to be effective. Additionally, AutoRec does not address the cold-start problem, making it challenging to provide recommendations for new users or items that lack prior ratings \cite{sedhain2015autorec}. 

\subsection{Content-enriched Recommendation}
\subsubsection{Convolutional Neural Networks}
Traditional recommender systems mainly model a user's general preferences based on past interactions and fail to account for sequential dependencies, where more recent interactions are stronger indicators of future behavior. Top-N sequential recommendation addresses this by predicting the next items a user will likely engage with based on their recent activity but current Markov Chain-based models have limitations. They treat past items independently rather than collectively which it would fail to capture skip behaviors, where earlier actions may still have an impact even if intermediate steps are unrelated. To address these gaps, the authors \cite{tang2018personalized} propose Caser (Convolutional Sequence Embedding Recommendation Model), which takes advantage of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to model sequential patterns in recommendation. Caser represents a sequence of recent items as an embedding matrix and applies horizontal and vertical convolutional filters to detect both union-level and point-level sequential patterns. Additionally, it incorporates user embeddings to personalize recommendations and allows for skip behaviors, making it more flexible in comparison to traditional Markov models \cite{tang2018personalized}.

Caser is evaluated on MovieLens, Gowalla, Foursquare, and Tmall datasets, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art models such as Factorized personalized Markov
chains (FPMC), Fossil, and GRU4Rec in Precision@N, Recall@N, and MAP (Mean Average Precision). Results show that horizontal filters improve sequential modeling by capturing dependencies where multiple past actions jointly influence recommendations, while vertical filters effectively model point-level patterns. Caser also has some limitations: its performance varies across datasets, it requires more computation than simpler models like FPMC, and it is sensitive to hyperparameters, making training more complex \cite{tang2018personalized}.
\subsubsection{Attention Networks}

\subsection{Temporal models}
\subsubsection{Recurrent Neural Networks}
Recommender systems rely on long-term user histories to generate personalized recommendations, but in many real-world scenarios—such as e-commerce sites and media platforms—user tracking is unreliable or infeasible due to privacy concerns and short user engagement. In these cases, session-based recommendation is important, where recommendations are made based only on a user's recent interactions within a session. Existing methods, including item-to-item similarity models and Markov Chain-based approaches, are limited because they either consider only the last interaction or struggle to model long-term dependencies in user behavior. To address these shortcomings, the authors of \cite{hidasi2015session} propose a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based model with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), which captures sequential dependencies by processing an entire session as a sequence. Unlike traditional models, GRUs dynamically update their hidden state with each user interaction, learning richer session representations. Additionally, the model incorporates a ranking-based loss function for better recommendation accuracy and optimizations like session-parallel mini-batches and negative sampling for efficient training \cite{hidasi2015session}.

The GRU-based model is evaluated on RecSys Challenge 2015 (RSC15) and a YouTube-like VIDEO dataset, showing up to a 25\% improvement in Recall@20 compared to state-of-the-art baselines like item-KNN and Bayesian Personalized Ranking Matrix Factorization (BPR-MF). Results indicate that the model effectively captures sequential dependencies, leading to more relevant recommendations. However, it has some limitations: higher training complexity, requiring GPU acceleration for scalability; lack of content-based features, meaning it relies purely on session interactions; and difficulty in hyperparameter tuning, as ranking loss functions require extensive experimentation. Additionally, like most collaborative filtering models, it still suffers from the cold-start problem, struggling to recommend items for new users with no prior interactions \cite{hidasi2015session}.

\subsection{Deep Reinforcement Learning Frameworks}

Traditional news recommendation methods is formulated as an optimization problem that maximize the immediate engagement, assuming a fixed user preference. However, this approach fails to optimize long-term user engagement, as news consumption is time-sensitive and user interests evolve over time. Moreover, current recommendations influence future engagement, making only optimizing current reward suboptimal \cite{zheng_drn_2018}. To achieve sustained engagement over an infinite horizon, the recommendation system is better modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the objective is to maximize cumulative future rewards. In this formulation, the state represents a user's recent reading history and current news, the action is recommending some news articles, and the reward is engagement-based metrics\cite{zheng_drn_2018}. The policy improvement theorem and contraction mapping of state-action value functions (Q-function) guarantee the existence and convergence of the optimal recommendation policy. However, solving this MDP exactly is intractable due to the high-dimensional state-action space, as there are infinitely many news states and infinitely many recommendation combinations. To address this, the authors propose using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) for functional approximation to compress state and action spaces, enabling generalization across unseen states\cite{zheng_drn_2018}. Further enhancements include Double Q-Learning (DDQN) to mitigate overestimation bias, experience replay for stable learning, activeness scores to dynamically weight user engagement, and Dueling Bandit Gradient Descent (DBGD) to refine exploration-exploitation trade-off via pairwise comparisons. 

The proposed method and its enhanced variant, Double DQN (DDQN) + all tricks, outperform all baseline methods, including Logistic Regression (LR), Factorization Machines (FM), Wide \& Deep (W\&D), and bandit-based approaches (LinUCB, HLinUCB). The DDQN model achieves the highest CTR (0.1662) and nDCG (0.4877), demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning in optimizing long-term engagement. The dueling network architecture improves user-news interaction modeling, while future reward consideration in DDQN leads to additional gains in recommendation accuracy. However, in the offline setting, incorporating user activeness and exploration does not show significant improvements due to dataset limitations, as interactions are static, preventing effective exploration. The authors note that na\"{i}ve exploration strategies like $\varepsilon$-greedy can harm recommendation accuracy, suggesting that exploration should be designed more carefully. The authors propose evaluating the model in an online setting, where user engagement evolves dynamically, allowing better assessment of exploration strategies and activeness-aware recommendations. Additionally, integrating more advanced exploration methods and personalized reward functions could further enhance long-term engagement optimization.

% \section{Remaining Tasks \& Future Work}
% As part of our project, we will further explore additional optimization techniques, specifically Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) frameworks and Attention Networks, to provide a more comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art optimization methods in recommendation systems. DRL introduces a decision-making perspective to recommendation, optimizing long-term user engagement, while Attention Networks enhance personalization by selectively prioritizing relevant interactions. Each of the methods discussed has distinct strengths and trade-offs. Autoencoders excel in learning compact latent representations but struggle with cold-start scenarios. CNN-based models, such as Caser, effectively capture sequential patterns but require careful hyperparameter tuning. RNNs, particularly GRU-based models, improve session-based recommendation by leveraging temporal dependencies, but they come with higher computational costs. In addition, we will conduct a critical evaluation and discussion of all the methods reviewed, highlighting their relative strengths, weaknesses, and practical applications. Our final report will include a comparative analysis of these techniques, offering insights into their effectiveness across different recommendation scenarios and outlining key considerations.



% \subsection{ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS}
% Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text,
% even after they have already been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations
% such as IEEE, SI, ac, and dc do not have to be defined. Abbreviations that
% incorporate periods should not have spaces: write ``C.N.R.S.,'' not ``C. N.
% R. S.'' Do not use abbreviations in the title unless they are unavoidable
% (for example, ``IEEE'' in the title of this article).

% \subsection{OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS}
% Use one space after periods and colons. Hyphenate complex modifiers:
% ``zero-field-cooled magnetization.'' Avoid dangling participles, such as,
% ``Using (1), the potential was calculated.'' [It is not clear who or what
% used (1).] Write instead, ``The potential was calculated by using (1),'' or
% ``Using (1), we calculated the potential.''

% Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25,'' not ``.25.'' Use ``cm$^3$,'' not
% ``cc.'' Indicate sample dimensions as ``0.1 cm \texttimes 0.2 cm,'' not
% ``0.1 \texttimes 0.2 cm$^{2}$.'' The abbreviation for ``seconds'' is ``s,''
% not ``sec.'' Use ``Wb/m$^{2}$'' or ``webers per square meter,'' not
% ``webers/m$^2$.'' When expressing a range of values, write ``7 to 9'' or
% ``7-9,'' not ``7\textasciitilde 9.''

% A parenthetical statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of
% the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated
% within the parentheses.) In American English, periods and commas are within
% quotation marks, like ``this period.'' Other punctuation is ``outside''!
% Avoid contractions; for example, write ``do not'' instead of ``don't.'' The
% serial comma is preferred: ``A, B, and C'' instead of ``A, B and C.''

% If you wish, you may write in the first person singular or plural and use
% the active voice (``I observed that \textellipsis'' or ``We observed that \textellipsis''
% instead of ``It was observed that \textellipsis''). Remember to check spelling.

% Try to avoid using too many typefaces in the same article.
% Remember that MathJax cannot handle nonstandard typefaces.

% \subsection{EQUATIONS}
% To make your equations more
% compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or appropriate
% exponents. Use parentheses to avoid ambiguities in denominators. Punctuate
% equations when they are part of a sentence, as in
% \begin{equation}
% \label{eq1}
% x=\frac{111111111}{12345679}=9 .
% \end{equation}
% Note that $x$ is math mode because it is a variable.
% Be sure that the symbols in your equation have been defined before the
% equation appears or immediately following. Italicize symbols ($T$ might refer
% to temperature, but T is the unit tesla). Refer to ``(1),'' not ``Eq. (1)''
% or ``equation (1),'' except at the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation (1)
% is \textellipsis .''

% \subsection{\LaTeX-SPECIFIC ADVICE}

% Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
% of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
% to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
% citations without having to go through the file line by line.

% Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
% \verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
% environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.

% Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
% will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
% equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
% article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
% the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
% counting.

% {\BibTeX} gets the bibliographic data from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
% bibliography you must send either the .bbl file or the .bib files.
% If you use \texttt{biblatex}, please send the .bib file. The .bbl file
% generated by \texttt{biblatex} is not designed to be edited.

% If you assign the same label to a
% subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table 1 has been cross
% referenced as Table IV-B3.

% If you put a
% \verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
% supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
% cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
% should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.

% Do not use \verb|\nonumber| or \verb|\notag| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
% will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
% any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
% surrounding equation.

% \section{UNITS}
% Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are strongly
% encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses).
% This applies to papers in data storage. For example, write ``15 Gb/cm$^{2}$
% (100 Gb/in$^{2})$.'' An exception is when English units are used as
% identifiers in trade, such as ``3\textonehalf -in disk drive.'' Avoid
% combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in
% oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance
% dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each
% quantity in an equation.

% The SI unit for magnetic field strength $H$ is A/m. However, if you wish to use
% units of T, either refer to magnetic flux density $B$ or magnetic field
% strength symbolized as \textmu $_{0}H$. Use the center dot to separate
% compound units, e.g., ``A\textbullet m$^{2}$.''

% \section{SOME COMMON MISTAKES}
% The word ``data'' is plural, not singular. The subscript for the
% permeability of vacuum \textmu $_{0}$ is zero, not a lowercase letter ``o.''
% The term for residual magnetization is ``remanence''; the adjective is
% ``remanent''; do not write ``remnance'' or ``remnant.'' Use the word
% ``micrometer'' instead of ``micron.'' A graph within a graph is an
% ``inset,'' not an ``insert.'' The word ``alternatively'' is preferred to the
% word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates). Use
% the word ``whereas'' instead of ``while'' (unless you are referring to
% simultaneous events). Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean
% ``approximately'' or ``effectively.'' Do not use the word ``issue'' as a
% euphemism for ``problem.'' When compositions are not specified, separate
% chemical symbols by en-dashes; for example, ``NiMn'' indicates the
% intermetallic compound Ni$_{0.5}$Mn$_{0.5}$ whereas ``Ni--Mn'' indicates an
% alloy of some composition Ni$_{x}$Mn$_{1-x}$.

% Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' (usually a
% verb) and ``effect'' (usually a noun), ``complement'' and ``compliment,''
% ``discreet'' and ``discrete,''
% ``principal'' (e.g., ``principal investigator'') and ``principle''
% (e.g., ``principle of measurement''). Do not confuse ``imply'' and
% ``infer.''

% Prefixes such as ``non,'' ``sub,'' ``micro,'' ``multi,'' and ``ultra'' are
% not independent words; they should be joined to the words they modify,
% usually without a hyphen. There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin
% abbreviation ``{et al.}'' The abbreviation ``i.e.,'' means
% ``that is,'' and the abbreviation ``e.g.,'' means ``for example'' (these
% abbreviations are not italicized).

% Figures compiled of more than one sub-figure presented side-by-side, or
% stacked. If a multipart figure is made up of multiple figure types (one part
% is lineart, and another is grayscale or color) the figure should meet the
% stricter guidelines.

% \subsection{FILE FORMATS FOR GRAPHICS}
% Format and save your graphics using a suitable graphics processing program
% that will allow you to create the images as PostScript (PS), Encapsulated
% PostScript (.EPS), Tagged Image File Format (.TIFF), Portable Document
% Format (.PDF), or Portable Network Graphics (.PNG) sizes them, and adjusts
% the resolution settings. If you created your source files in one of the
% following programs you will be able to submit the graphics without
% converting to a PS, EPS, TIFF, PDF, or PNG file: Microsoft Word, Microsoft
% PowerPoint, or Microsoft Excel. Though it is not required, it is strongly
% recommended that these files be saved in PDF format rather than DOC, XLS, or
% PPT. Doing so will protect your figures from common font and arrow stroke
% issues that occur when working on the files across multiple platforms. When
% submitting your final paper, your graphics should all be submitted
% individually in one of these formats along with the manuscript.

% \subsection{SIZING OF GRAPHICS}
% Most charts, graphs, and tables are one column wide (3.5 inches / 88
% millimeters / 21 picas) or page wide (7.16 inches / 181 millimeters / 43
% picas). The maximum depth a graphic can be is 8.5 inches (216 millimeters /
% 54 picas). When choosing the depth of a graphic, please allow space for a
% caption. Figures can be sized between column and page widths if the author
% chooses, however it is recommended that figures are not sized less than
% column width unless when necessary.

% The final printed size of author photographs is exactly
% 1 inch wide by 1.25 inches tall (25.4 millimeters x 31.75 millimeters / 6
% picas x 7.5 picas). Author photos printed in editorials measure 1.59 inches
% wide by 2 inches tall (40 millimeters x 50 millimeters / 9.5 picas x 12
% picas).

% \subsection{RESOLUTION}
% The proper resolution of your figures will depend on the type of figure it
% is as defined in the ``Types of Figures'' section. Author photographs,
% color, and grayscale figures should be at least 300dpi. Line art, including
% tables should be a minimum of 600dpi.

% \subsection{VECTOR ART}
% In order to preserve the figures' integrity across multiple computer
% platforms, we accept files in the following formats: .EPS/.PDF/.PS. All
% fonts must be embedded or text converted to outlines in order to achieve the
% best-quality results.

% \subsection{COLOR SPACE}
% The term color space refers to the entire sum of colors that can be
% represented within the said medium. For our purposes, the three main color
% spaces are Grayscale, RGB (red/green/blue) and CMYK
% (cyan/magenta/yellow/black). RGB is generally used with on-screen graphics,
% whereas CMYK is used for printing purposes.

% All color figures should be generated in RGB or CMYK color space. Grayscale
% images should be submitted in Grayscale color space. Line art may be
% provided in grayscale OR bitmap colorspace. Note that ``bitmap colorspace''
% and ``bitmap file format'' are not the same thing. When bitmap color space
% is selected, .TIF/.TIFF/.PNG are the recommended file formats.

% \subsection{ACCEPTED FONTS WITHIN FIGURES}
% When preparing your graphics IEEE suggests that you use of one of the
% following Open Type fonts: Times New Roman, Helvetica, Arial, Cambria, and
% Symbol. If you are supplying EPS, PS, or PDF files all fonts must be
% embedded. Some fonts may only be native to your operating system; without
% the fonts embedded, parts of the graphic may be distorted or missing.

% A safe option when finalizing your figures is to strip out the fonts before
% you save the files, creating ``outline'' type. This converts fonts to
% artwork what will appear uniformly on any screen.

% \subsection{USING LABELS WITHIN FIGURES}
% \subsubsection{Figure Axis Labels}
% a) Figure axis labels are often a source of confusion. Use words rather than
% symbols. As an example, write the quantity ``Magnetization,'' or
% ``Magnetization $M$,'' not just ``$M$.'' Put units in parentheses. Do not label
% axes only with units. As in Figure 1, for example, write ``Magnetization
% (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization (A$\cdot $m$^{-1})$,'' not just ``A/m.'' Do not
% label axes with a ratio of quantities and units. For example, write
% ``Temperature (K),'' not ``Temperature/K.''

% b) Multipliers can be especially confusing. Write ``Magnetization (kA/m)'' or
% ``Magnetization (10$^{3}$ A/m).'' Do not write ``Magnetization (A/m)
% \texttimes 1000'' because the reader would not know whether the top axis
% label in Figure 1 meant 16000 A/m or 0.016 A/m. Figure labels should be
% legible, approximately 8 to 10 point type.

% \subsubsection{Subfigure Labels in Multipart Figures and Tables}
% Multipart figures should be combined and labeled before final submission.
% Labels should appear centered below each subfigure in 8 point Times New
% Roman font in the format of (a) (b) (c).

% \subsection{FILE NAMING}
% Figures (line artwork or photographs) should be named starting with the
% first 5 letters of the author's last name. The next characters in the
% filename should be the number that represents the sequential location of
% this image in your article. For example, in author ``Anderson's'' paper, the
% first three figures would be named ander1.tif, ander2.tif, and ander3.ps.

% Tables should contain only the body of the table (not the caption) and
% should be named similarly to figures, except that ``.t'' is inserted
% in-between the author's name and the table number. For example, author
% Anderson's first three tables would be named ander.t1.tif, ander.t2.ps,
% ander.t3.eps.

% Author photographs should be named using the first five characters of the
% pictured author's last name. For example, four author photographs for a
% paper may be named: oppen.ps, moshc.tif, chen.eps, and duran.pdf.

% If two authors or more have the same last name, their first initial(s) can
% be substituted for the fifth, fourth, third\textellipsis letters of their surname
% until the degree where there is differentiation. For example, two authors
% Michael and Monica Oppenheimer's photos would be named oppmi.tif, and
% oppmo.eps.

% \subsection{REFERENCING A FIGURE OR TABLE WITHIN YOUR PAPER}
% When referencing your figures and tables within your paper, use Figure
% and Table. Do not abbreviate. Tables should be numbered with Arabic Numerals.

% \subsection{SUBMITTING YOUR GRAPHICS}
% Because IEEE will do the final formatting of your paper,
% you do not need to position figures and tables at the top and bottom of each
% column. In fact, all figures, figure captions, and tables can be placed at
% the end of your paper. In addition to, or even in lieu of submitting figures
% within your final manuscript, figures should be submitted individually,
% separate from the manuscript in one of the file formats listed above in
% Section VI-J. Place figure captions below the figures; place table titles
% above the tables. Please do not include captions as part of the figures, or
% put them in ``text boxes'' linked to the figures. Also, do not place borders
% around the outside of your figures.

% \subsection{COLOR PROCESSING / PRINTING IN IEEE JOURNALS}
% Electronically published journals allow authors to use color without extra charge.
% For journals that will print, the charge for print color is \$275 per color figure.
% Figures for print journals will otherwise appear in color online, black and white in print (free, no charge).

% \section{CONCLUSION}
% A conclusion section is not required. Although a conclusion may review the
% main points of the paper, do not replicate the abstract as the conclusion. A
% conclusion might elaborate on the importance of the work or suggest
% applications and extensions.

% \section*{APPENDIX}
% Appendixes, if needed, appear before the acknowledgment.

% \section*{REFERENCES AND FOOTNOTES}
% \subsection{REFERENCES}
% References need not be cited in text. When they are, they appear on the
% line, in square brackets, inside the punctuation. Multiple references are
% each numbered with separate brackets. When citing a section in a book,
% please give the relevant page numbers. In text, refer simply to the
% reference number. Do not use ``Ref.'' or ``reference'' except at the
% beginning of a sentence: ``Reference [3] shows \textellipsis .'' Please do not use
% automatic endnotes in \textit{Word}, rather, type the reference list at the end of the
% paper using the ``References'' style.

% Reference numbers are set flush left and form a column of their own, hanging
% out beyond the body of the reference. The reference numbers are on the line,
% enclosed in square brackets. In all references, the given name of the author
% or editor is abbreviated to the initial only and precedes the last name. Use
% them all; use \textit{et al}.\ only if names are not given.
% Abbreviate conference titles. When citing IEEE Transactions,
% provide the issue number, page range, volume number, year, and/or month if
% available. When referencing a patent, provide the day and the month of
% issue, or application. References may not include all information; please
% obtain and include relevant information. Do not combine references. There
% must be only one reference with each number. If there is a URL included with
% the print reference, it can be included at the end of the reference.

% Other than books, capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except
% for proper nouns and element symbols. For papers published in translation
% journals, please give the English citation first, followed by the original
% foreign-language citation. See the end of this document for formats and
% examples of common references. For a complete discussion of references and
% their formats, see the IEEE style manual at

% \subsection{FOOTNOTES}
% Number footnotes separately in superscripts (Insert\textbar
% Footnote).\footnote{It is recommended that footnotes be avoided. Instead,
% try to integrate the footnote information into the text.} Place the actual
% footnote at the bottom of the column in which it is cited; do not put
% footnotes in the reference list (endnotes). Use letters for table footnotes
% (see Table 1).

% {FIRST A. AUTHOR}~(Fellow, IEEE)~and all authors may include biographies.
% Biographies are often not included in conference-related papers. This author
% is an IEEE Fellow. The first paragraph may contain a place and/or date of
% birth (list place, then date). Next, the author's educational background is
% listed. The degrees should be listed with type of degree in what field,
% which institution, city, state, and country, and year the degree was earned.
% The author's major field of study should be lower-cased.

% The second paragraph uses the pronoun of the person (he or she) and not the
% author's last name. It lists military and work experience, including summer
% and fellowship jobs. Job titles are capitalized. The current job must have a
% location; previous positions may be listed without one. Information
% concerning previous publications may be included. Try not to list more than
% three books or published articles. The format for listing publishers of a
% book within the biography is: title of book (publisher name, year) similar
% to a reference. Current and previous research interests end the paragraph.

% The third paragraph begins with the author's title and last name
% (e.g., Dr.\ Smith, Prof.\ Jones, Mr.\ Kajor, Ms.\ Hunter). List any memberships in
% professional societies other than the IEEE. Finally, list any awards and
% work for IEEE committees and publications. If a photograph is provided, it
% should be of good quality, and professional-looking.
